This fork downloads images from a given IMAP server to a date-stamped folder, ignoring sender and email ID. 


Imapfiles was developed as free software to download the attachments contained in emails on an IMAP capable email server and optionally
archive those messages to another imap folder once processed.


The python code can be used from the command line or as a module for use in other python scripts.


Usage: imapfiles [OPTIONS]

Options:

-c, --config
    path to a ini style config file. e.g.
    
    [general]
    destination=./files
    [imap]
    server=localhost
    username=username
    password=password
    folder=INBOX
    archive=archive

-s, --server
    imap server name or ip address

-u, --username
    imap users name

-p, --password

-f, --folder
    imap folder to download attachemnts from

-d, --destination

    attachments are stored in date folders (bnsed on the emails sent date) with sub folders for each message.

-a, --archive
    you can optionally specify an existing imap folder to archive processed emails to avoid downloading attachments again
    the next time this is performed.

Examples:

python ./imapfiles -c imapfiles.cfg
python ./imapfiles -s localhost -u username -p password -f INBOX -d localdirectory
